## TL;DR

* **Feb 2025:** Nima Aksoy and I started sketching [**Bestofweb.site**](http://Bestofweb.site)—a practical toolkit for developers and entrepreneurs.
    
* **Phase 1:** Launched a **minimal, open startup directory** so anyone can list a product in minutes.
    
* **Phase 2:** Shipped **AI Blog Automation**—authentic, business-aware articles + images + scheduling + automated internal/external linking.
    
* **Phase 3 (now in beta):** **Social Scheduling**—connect Instagram, Facebook, Threads, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, X; publish once, schedule everywhere.
    
* **What’s next:** More growth tools, deeper integrations, and a community roadmap.

## Why we built it

I’ve always built out of need. In **February 2025**, over a string of calls and whiteboard sketches, **Nima Aksoy** and I kept asking the same question:

> *“What tools do we wish we had as builders—and how quickly can we ship a useful version for others like us?”*

That question became [**Bestofweb.site**](http://Bestofweb.site): a focused, opinionated set of tools for **developers and entrepreneurs** who want to launch faster, reach audiences earlier, and keep their content alive without burning time and cash.

---

## Phase 1 — Start with the smallest useful thing: a directory

We began with a **minimal startup directory**—no fluff, no friction.

* **Frictionless listing:** Anyone can submit their startup in minutes.
    
* **Useful categorisation:** Practical tags so the right people actually find you.
    
* **Founder-friendly:** We focused on utility and discoverability.
    

Why a directory first? Because visibility is oxygen. If people can’t find your product, nothing else matters.

---

## Phase 2 — AI Blog Automation: authentic content, automatically

Shortly after launching the directory, we kept hearing the same pain point:

> *“Our blog is dead.”*

So we built **AI Blog Automation**—a service that plugs into a business (or personal blog) and **creates authentic, on-brand content**, then **generates images** and **schedules** it—all with minimal overhead.

**What it does:**

* **Understands the business:** We ingest context about your product, audience, and tone.
    
* **Writes like you:** Every article is **personalised** to the brand’s nature and goals.
    
* **Adds images automatically:** Cohesive visuals that match the article’s topic and style.
    
* **Schedules for you:** Set your cadence, and we publish on time—every time.
    
* **Builds discoverability:** We created internal and external **backlinking** flows so each article strengthens the next, linking to relevant content to grow authority and reach.
    

**Results we’re seeing:**

* Blogs that were dormant are now **alive and compounding**.
    
* Teams save **hours per week** and **real money** they’d otherwise spend on content pipelines.
    
* Articles don’t just exist—they **interlink** and **rank** better over time.

## Phase 3 — Social Scheduling (beta): one post, everywhere

The next obvious pain: social publishing is scattered and repetitive. So we’re in **beta** with **Social Scheduling**.

**Connect once, publish everywhere:**

* **Instagram, Facebook, Threads, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, X** (more coming).
    
* Draft once → **schedule to many** in a single flow.
    
* Great for solo founders, busy teams, and anyone who wants consistency without chaos.
    

It’s in **beta**, but **usable right now**—and we’re iterating quickly based on real user feedback.

---

## The product philosophy that guided us

1. **Ship the smallest useful version.** Then iterate.
    
2. **Build for real needs.** If we wouldn’t use it weekly, we don’t ship it.
    
3. **Automate the boring parts.** Publishing, images, links, and scheduling should run on rails.
    
4. **Compound distribution.** Every asset should strengthen others (directories → posts → links → socials).
    
5. **Keep creators in control.** AI helps; **humans lead**.
    

---

## What’s next

* **Deeper and better integrations** (more platforms + analytics you actually need).
    
* **Richer SEO playbooks** baked into the automation engine.
    
* **Team workflows**: approvals, brand libraries, multi-workspace support.
    
* **Community roadmap**: public feedback → fast cycles.
    

If you’re a developer or entrepreneur who wants to **launch sooner, publish consistently, and grow smarter**, you’re exactly who we’re building for.

---

## Try it / Join the beta

* **List your product** in the directory: [*Bestofweb.site*](http://Bestofweb.site)
    
* **Activate AI Blog Automation:** Connect your blog, set your cadence, and let it run.
    
* **Join Social Scheduling (beta):** Connect socials and schedule once for many.
    

Have ideas? Break something? Want a feature yesterday? I’d love to hear it.

## Lessons we learned

* **Distribution-first beats perfection.** A simple directory + shareable links drove meaningful early usage.
    
* **Authenticity scales if you model it.** Capture brand voice and product truths first; AI can honour it.
    
* **Links are leverage.** Internal + external linking turned single posts into **content networks**.
    
* **Scheduling is a growth moat.** Consistency compounds visibility more than clever tactics.
    
* **Talk to users.** Feature requests &gt; assumptions.
